Number problems examples:
1) Given 2 numbers X & Y, find X power Y.
2) Given 2 numbers X & Y, find LCM and GCD.
3) Given a number X, compute X factorial.
4) Given an array of numbers, find the highest number, lowest number, Kth highest number, Kth lowest number.
5) Given an array of numbers, find mean, median & standard deviation.
6) Sort the array in ascending or descending.
7) Search for a given number using linear search, binary search.
8) After you read about trees, construct a binary search tree.

Strings & Arrays Problems:
1) Given a string S and a substring SUBSTR, check if SUBSTR exists in the main string.
2) Given a string S and a substring, insert the substring at Kth position in the main string.
3) Given a string, delete from positions i to k in the string.
4) Given a string S and a substring, replace all occurences of the substr with single character X.
5) Given an array if strings, sort then ascending or descending order.
6) Given an array if strings, find if another string S exists in an array.
7) Given an array if strings, remove duplicates.
8) Given a matrix MXN, find the lowest number in the matrix.
9) Given a square matrix, compute the transpose.
10) Given a matrix MXN, compute a matrix of MX1 where each row is the sum of all numbers in the row in the original matrix. Compute another matrix 1XN,
    sum of all numbers in the column in the original matrix.
11) Reverse the string.
